# True Positive Datasets

- [Helwak 2013 CLASH](Helwak%202013%20CLASH.md)
- [mirMark](mirMark.md)

To test the proposed deepTarget, we utilized a public human miRNA-mRNA pairing data repository [mirMark](mirMark.md), which provides both site-level and gene-level datasets. The creators of this repository obtained validated target sites from miRecords database and mature human miRNA sequences from mirBase database.
