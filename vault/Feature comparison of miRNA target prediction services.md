# What Are the Effects of New Columns of Tarpmir?

>The selected new features significantly improved the prediction accuracy of TarPmiR. To show the contribution of the new features to the accuracy of TarPmiR, we removed the seven new features and retrained random forests in TarPmiR. Compared with the original TarPmiR with 13 features, the recall and precision of the modified TarPmiR dropped 8.6% and 9.7%, respectively.
