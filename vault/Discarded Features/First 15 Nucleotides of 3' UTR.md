# First 15 Nucleotides of 3' UTR

TargetScan discards other mRNA regions than 3' UTR. TargetScan also discards first 15 nt of 3' UTR, because of steric hindrance caused by ribosomes.

>Sites in 5'UTRs, in ORFs, or within 15 nt of the stop codon were excluded, in accord with our results showing that such sites were generally not effective.

>3'UTR sites within 15 nt of the stop codon were less effective on the array, compared to sites elsewhere in the 3'UTR. These results confirmed that the segment immediately following the stop codon was inhospitable for targeting.
