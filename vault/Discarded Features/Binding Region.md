# Binding Region

A categorical column named binding_region that contains if the match is in 5' UTR, CDS or 3' UTR

Inspiration is from CLASH, where it says some miRNAs have specific preferences for their target region

---

> Notably, different miRNAs vary in the relative proportions of targets in 5′ UTRs, coding sequences, and 3′ UTRs. As examples, miR-100 returned 4% 5′ UTR: 23% CDS: 73% 3′ UTR, whereas miR-149 returned 8% 5′ UTR: 72% CDS: 19% 3′ UTR (data not shown).
