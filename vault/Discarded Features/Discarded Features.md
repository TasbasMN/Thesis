# Global AU Composition

>High global AU composition within 3'UTRs also correlates with a higher density of conserved miRNA complementary sites, as well as higher 3'UTR conservation more broadly ([Robins and Press, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800283/#R23)). When considering nucleotide composition of the entire 3'UTR, we observed a correlation between global AU content and efficacy on the array. However, this correlation was not as strong as for local composition, and after accounting for local AU context, no significant residual correlation remained for global AU composition, indicating that global AU composition does not directly influence site efficacy.

# Potential Role of Pairing to miRNA Nucleotides 9 and 10

>The potential role of pairing to miRNA nucleotides 9 and 10 has been controversial. We found that extending pairing to nucleotides 9 or 10 neither enhanced nor diminished affinity in the context of seed matched sites.

# Centered Sites

TargetScan doesn't use the noncanonical interaction "centered sites" as it doesn't appear to be functional.

>Centered sites, which do not appear to be functional for most miRNAs are no longer considered or displayed in TargetScan.
