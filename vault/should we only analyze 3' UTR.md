>**Sites in 5'UTRs, in ORFs, or within 15 nt of the stop codon were excluded, in accord with our results showing that such sites were generally not effective.**

>**Additional evidence that miRNA sites must remain bound in order to confer repression came from the reduced site effectiveness in the 5'UTR and ORF, which presumably results from displacement of silencing complexes as the ribosome translocates from the cap-binding complex to the stop codon.** We found that this effect extended beyond the stop codon and into the first ~15 nt of the 3'UTR. The length of ~15 nt was in agreement with the observation that mRNA enters the ribosome ~15 nt downstream of the decoding site ([Yusupova et al., 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800283/#R30); [Takyar et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800283/#R27)), which would presumably strip off any silencing complex and block rebinding until the ribosome dissociated from the message.

#### Why does miRWalk search possible miRNA binding sites within the complete sequence of a gene?

>For more than a decade, attempts to study the  interaction of miRNAs with their targets were limited to the mRNA 3'-UTR  region. However, several investigators have recently suggested an  alternative mode of gene regulation in which miRNAs anneal within the  cds, 5'- and/or 3'-UTR regions of their targets thereby regulating their  translation. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to search  possible miRNA binding sites within the **complete sequence** (5'-UTR, CDS and 3'-UTR) of a gene.
