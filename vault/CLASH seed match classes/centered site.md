# centered site

This site type, which we call the “centered site,” was characterized by at least 11 nt of contiguous Watson-Crick base pairing to the center region of the miRNA at either nt 4–14 or 5–15, without substantial pairing to either the 5′ or the 3′ ends of the miRNA. Because of the location and extent of their base pairing, these sites occupy a position intermediate between seed sites and the extensively complementary cleavage sites.
