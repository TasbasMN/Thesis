# Site Accessibility

The accessibility is calculated using the cost of free energy to unfold the mRNA at the seed region to bind the miRNA (Kertesz et al. 2007).

TargetScan uses the following criteria:
- Probability that a 14 nt segment centered on the match to sRNA positions 7 and 8 is unpaired

**The accessibility** was proposed in *(Kertesz, M., Iovino, N., Unnerstall, U., Gaul, U. and Segal, E. (2007) The role of site accessibility in microRNA target recognition. Nature genetics, 39, 1278-1284)*.

>Accessibility, which measures how likely a region in an mRNA sequence is ‘open’ or accessible for an miRNA to bind, is well known to be important for functional miRNA–mRNA binding ([Kertesz](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018371/#btw318-B20) *[et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018371/#btw318-B20)*[, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018371/#btw318-B20)).
