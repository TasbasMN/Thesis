# Site Accessibility

>The accessibility is calculated using the cost of free energy to unfold the mRNA at the seed region to bind the miRNA (Kertesz et al. 2007).

>Accessibility, which measures how likely a region in an mRNA sequence is ‘open’ or accessible for an miRNA to bind, is well known to be important for functional miRNA–mRNA binding

>Accessibility is measured as the probability that a region of predefined length u is free of base pairing in thermodynamic equilibrium.
>Base-pairing probabilities (restricted by L) and accessibility (of the region u) are averaged over all windows W (W 4 L) that contain the stretch u.
