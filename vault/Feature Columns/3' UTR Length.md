# 3' UTR Length

The length of the targeted 3' UTR region.

---

TargetScan discards other mRNA regions than 3' UTR. TargetScan also discards first 15 nt of 3' UTR, because of steric hindrance caused by ribosomes.

>Sites in 5'UTRs, in ORFs, or within 15 nt of the stop codon were excluded, in accord with our results showing that such sites were generally not effective.
