# Target Abundance (TA)

"TA in the human transcriptome was calculated as the number of non-overlapping 3â€²UTR 8mer, 7mer-m8, and 7mer-A1 sites in the reference mRNAs."

*(Weak seed-pairing stability and high target-site abundance decrease the proficiency of lsy-6 and other microRNAs, 2011, https://doi.org/10.1038/nsmb.2115)*
