# Site Accessibility

>Accessibility, which measures how likely a region in an mRNA sequence is ‘open’ or accessible for an miRNA to bind, is well known to be important for functional miRNA–mRNA binding ([Kertesz](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018371/#btw318-B20) _[et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018371/#btw318-B20)_[, 2007](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018371/#btw318-B20)).

TargetScan uses the following criteria:

>Probability that a 14 nt segment centered on the match to sRNA positions 7 and 8 is unpaired
