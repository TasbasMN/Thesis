# proximity to other MREs

>**Cooperation between multiple RISC's requires target sites to be close and is most effective when the distance is between 13 and 35â€‰nt.**

## Biological Intuition:

>Increased repression with multiple sites could be explained by an increased likelihood of any one site being bound or by a beneficial effect of having more than one silencing complex bound simultaneously.

>Our observation that overlapping or near-overlapping sites for two different miRNAs yielded less downregulation than did more distantly spaced sites favored the latter possibility.
