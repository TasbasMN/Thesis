# 3′ Supplementary Pairing

This feature looks for additional Watson-Crick pairing at bucleotides 13-16

---

> Overall, consequential pairing preferentially involved Watson-Crick pairing to miRNA nucleotides 12–17, most especially nucleotides 13–16

## Other Notes:

3' pairing can help compensate for imperfect seed pairing ([Doench and Sharp, 2004](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800283/#R4); [Brennecke et al., 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800283/#R3))
