Noncanonical sites are sites of interaction between a mRNA and a miRNA that do not involve the canonical pairing in the seed region (positions 2 - 7) of the miRNA. They are of two types:
- A 3' compensatory site is one in which strong 3' pairing (consequential miRNA-target complementarity outside the seed region) compensates for an imperfect seed match (Friedman et al., 2009). 
- A centered site is one that lacks perfect seed pairing and 3'-compensatory pairing but instead has 11-12 contiguous Watson-Crick pairs to miRNA positions 4-15. These are identified only in the reference species and therefore include no information about conservation.

Centered sites, which do not appear to be functional for most miRNAs are no longer considered or displayed in TargetScan.

However, since a 6 nt match presents on average every ∼4,000 nt, likely to be occurred often by chance, such strategies still suffer from both false-positive (∼40–66%) and false-negative predictions (∼50–70%) ([Mourelatos, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870184/#b55-molce-39-5-375)) even in the usage of microarray or proteomic approaches ([Baek et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870184/#b3-molce-39-5-375); [Selbach et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870184/#b66-molce-39-5-375)). Furthermore, seed-pairing rules cannot identify non-canonical target sites, which have been reported as functional ([Brodersen and Voinnet, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870184/#b8-molce-39-5-375)).
