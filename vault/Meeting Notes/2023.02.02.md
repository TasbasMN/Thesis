# Answers to Meeting Notes

## Deeptarget

Most important features mentioned in the paper:
- the degree of Watson-Crick matches of a seed sequence
- the degree of sequence conservation across species;
- Gibbs free energy, which measures the stability of the binding of a miRNA-mRNA pair
- the site accessibility, which measures the hybridization possibility of a pair from their secondary structures.

## miRNA-DNA Triplexes

miRNAs can wedge into the major groove of DNA, dictated by sequence. May directly alter expression

# What I Did in This Week?

- [True Positive Datasets](../True%20Positive%20Datasets/True%20Positive%20Datasets.md)
- literature review for "conservation" column
- [deepTarget, End-to-end Learning Framework for microRNA Target Prediction using Deep Recurrent Neural Networks](../Literature%20Notes/deepTarget,%20End-to-end%20Learning%20Framework%20for%20microRNA%20Target%20Prediction%20using%20Deep%20Recurrent%20Neural%20Networks.md)
- implemented a few column generating functions
