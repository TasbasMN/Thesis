## General Stuff

- configured linux environment
- learned & explored docker containers for packaging up the project
  - could work inside a container if ViennaRNA gets problematic

Why containerizing my work is important?

- Reproducibility
- Easy collaboration
- Portability (runs on any machine that can run docker)
- Scalability (just deploy additional containers & manage with container orchestration tools such as kubernetes)

example containers for bioinformatics (from <https://biocontainers.pro/>)

## Thesis Stuff

- extracted now useless db comparison methods to db_comparison.py
- generate_flanking_dinucleotides_columns() is fixed, removed arbitrary scoring of nucleotides

## ViennaRNA Stuff

- installed & ran ViennaRNA python plugin
- viennarna_examples.ipynb is used to figure out how ViennaRNA python package works
- Even asked ChatGPT for example uses, it delivered üëçüèª

## Tarpmir

- Thoroughly examined tarpmir.py to see how they implemented ViennaRNA calculations
  - they used subprocess.Popen() to run ViennaRNA instead of implementing into python
- Extracted useful snippets from tarpmir into a notebook
