## Meeting Notes

Available prediction tools that we can use:
- [miTAR](https://github.com/tjgu/miTAR)
	- This is available as a conda package.
- [DMISO](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14890-8), https://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/DMISO/
Has methods on how to analyse CLASH NGS data
Hint: Tarpmir also used CLASH data from the same study
Available as python package

- [RPmirDIP](https://borealisdata.ca/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.5683/SP2/LD8JKJ) has a data dump of predicted mRNA - miRNA interactions

- [metaRNA](https://github.com/prashnts/metaRNA)
Python library for calculating free energy and predicting targets for miRNAs.

- [miRmap](https://github.com/prashnts/mirmap)
This is discontinued in favor of metaRNA

- [SeqFold](https://pypi.org/project/seqfold/) package can be used to calculate free energy of miRNA molecules. This might be a feature in the model.

## Can We Access These?
