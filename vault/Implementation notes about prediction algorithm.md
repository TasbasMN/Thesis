# Implementation Notes About Prediction Algorithm

This is a random collection about stuff that will be useful during the implementation.

miRNA - miRNA complexes exist, but they are very rare.

>Interactions between pairs of distinct miRNAs were not very frequent (âˆ¼3%), but some were highly reproducible and apparently isoform specific

There are some implementation notes found in [miRmap](Literature%20Notes/miRmap.md).
