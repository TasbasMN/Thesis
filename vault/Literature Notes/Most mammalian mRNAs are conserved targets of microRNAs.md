hierarchy of site efficacy: 8mer > 7mer-m8 > 7mer-A1 > 6mer ([Grimson et al. 2007](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-9); [Nielsen et al. 2007](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-24)).

## Pairing to the 3′ End of miRNAs Displays Small but Measurable Excess Conservation

These features are captured in a 3′-pairing score, which awards one point for each contiguous Watson–Crick pair matching miRNA nucleotides 13–16 and a half point for each contiguous pair extending the pairing in either direction. Pairing segments offset from the miRNA are then penalized by subtracting a half point for each nucleotide of offset beyond ±2 nucleotides from the register directly opposite the miRNA, and then sites are assigned the score of the highest scoring pairing segment ([Grimson et al. 2007](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-9)).

Sites with scores ≥3 display modestly increased efficacy and conservation ([Grimson et al. 2007](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-9)).

## Selective Maintenance of 3′-compensatory Sites

Pairing to the 3′ portion of the miRNA can not only supplement a 7–8mer match, it can also compensate for a single-nucleotide bulge or mismatch in the seed region, as illustrated by the *let-7* miRNA sites in *lin-41* and the miR-196 site in *HOXB8* ([Vella et al. 2004](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-33); [Yekta et al. 2004](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-38))

Supporting this idea, all experimentally validated examples of metazoan 3′-compensatory sites involve pairing that centers on miRNA nucleotides 13–17 and extends to at least 9 contiguous Watson–Crick pairs, which corresponds to a 3′-pairing score ≥6.5 ([Vella et al. 2004](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-33); [Yekta et al. 2004](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/1/92.long#ref-38)).
